        <h1>LOGO DESIGN</h1>
        <p>The “Bloomguide” logo is composed of a variation of flowers blooming together and beginning to blossom
            outside of its encompassing circle; depicting the meaning of leaving one’s comfort zone. The shapes of the
            petals are more rounded to match with the circle shape of the logo itself. The lines are thin and follow the
            curve of the logo in order to allow the viewer's eyes to be brought up to the wordmark, “Bloomguide”.
            Finally, the colours itself are more earthy and warm toned, creating an elegant, yet modern, feel to the
            app.</p>
