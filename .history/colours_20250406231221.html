        <p>
            The colours we chose for Bloomguide are more earthy, meant to reflect the app’s purpose which is to help
            users find the perfect flower for any occasion. The warmer tones are meant to provide comfort to the users,
            inviting them to feel open to learning and understanding the different meanings and uses for flowers. Many
            people may find the idea of finding the perfect flower or bouquet overwhelming, which is why Bloomguide’s
            colour palette echoes the feeling of calm to its users.

            Bloomguide’s gradients are used to bring emphasis and confidence to the user experience. Primary buttons
            include a gradient that encourages users to take the survey and sign up to not just find the perfect
            flowers, but to also learn more about the world of floriculture.

        <div class="accessibility-grid">
            <div class="access-card">
                <h2>Red Background</h2>
                <p>This color passes the contrast check with both large and small text. If the red was any lighter, the
                    white text would become difficult to read. If there are lighter tints being used for the red, our
                    team ensures that the text is big enough to be legible.</p>
                <img src="images/red-background.png" alt="#" />
            </div>

            <div class="access-card">
                <h2>Yellow Background</h2>
                <p>This colour passes the contrast checker with both large and small text sizes. However, using this
                    colour with the red text font can cause some contrast issues. Our team avoids this by either using a
                    lighter tint of yellow, or simply using a white background for cards.</p>
                <img src="images/yellow-background.png" alt="#" />
            </div>

            <div class="access-card">
                <h2>Blue Background</h2>
                <p>Although this color passes the test, the smaller text can be difficult to see if the text is too
                    small. It is important for users to be able to properly read the text, so our team primarily uses
                    this colour for buttons that use a bigger font size.
                </p>

            <div class="access-card">
                <h2>White Background</h2>
                <p>Similar to the blue contrast test, this colour passes the test, however its smaller text may cause
                    some reading difficulty if the text is too small. Our team avoids this issue by ensuring the font
                    weight and size of the type is large or thick enough for the user to be able to read the text with
                    ease.</p>
