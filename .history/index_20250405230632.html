                    <p>I have learned so much and doubled my income potential from doing my diploma here. A difficult
                        school on the other hand? Absolutely, it's harder than any job and twice as difficult. I try to
                        keep my grades between 95-90% and it takes everything I have to keep up with 7 to 8 classes
                        every semester.</p>
